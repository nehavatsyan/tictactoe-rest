# Tic Tac Toe using Rest API
Repository consists of implementation of Tic Tac Toe with Rest Api using Go, Gin

Tic Tac Toe, or Noughts and Crosses for the rest of the world, is a nice simple game where players X and O (or cross and nought) alternate turns occupying cells on a game board until one player reaches a win condition or there are no more empty cells. This API represents the game as a set of valid board states and the viable transitions between the states.
